# Stronger DIN Rail Clips

When I first printed the stock Voron 2.4 DIN rail clips for the PSUs, SKRs and RPi I found them to be a bit too flimsy and they didn't hold the components in place as securely as I would have liked. I actually managed to quite easily snap off the part of the clip that attaches to the DIN rail on a couple of them so I decided to remodel them to make them much beefier.

Here you will find the alternative DIN rail clips that I made:

* Stronger version of the DIN rail clip for the 5V Mean Well PSU
* Stronger version of the DIN rail clips for the 24V Mean Well PSU (print both the L+R)
* Alternative DIN rail clips for the SKR1.3/1.4 which are stronger and also rotate the SKRs 90 degrees

Please refer to my separate GitHub folder for the stronger DIN rail mount for the Raspberry Pi which also supports an incorporated 4010 fan.
